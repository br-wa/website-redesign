<p>
    Welcome to my new blog (and personal site)!
    You can read more about me at my <a href="https://www.mit.edu/~brwa/">official website</a>.
    I am interested in using (social and computing) technologies to improve lives.
    I mostly write about my observations about the world, how to navigate it, and how to improve it.
    Occasionally I may also write about my own experiences.
</p>

<p>
    Currently, I am a student at MIT, graduating this May. 
    Next year, I will be learning about startups in the Bay Area.
