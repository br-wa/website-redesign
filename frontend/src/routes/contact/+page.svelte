<h4>Subscribe</h4>
<p>
    You can subscribe by sending me an email.
    Please mention subscribing in the subject line.
    (Note that subscriptions are currently not very fancy; 
    you will receive a (very generically formatted) email when I have new posts.)

<h4>Editing</h4>
<p>
    If you would like to help me edit/polish drafts, 
    please also let me know via email. 
    This means you get to see earlier drafts (including some that are not published
    because they are more experimental).
